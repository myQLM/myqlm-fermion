QLM fermion module
=============================

This module contains tools specific to spin and fermionic systems. It includes, among other things:
- various objects to describe fermionic and spin Hamiltonians,
- various transformations between fermionic and spin representations,
- a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), as well as the fermionic and qubit version of ADAPT-VQE,
- a trotterization module,
- a quantum phase estimation module,
- various tools for electronic structure study,
- ...

Installation
----------------

You can install the fermion module with pip directly from the internet:
```shell
pip install myqlm-fermion
```
or install from the sources directly :
```python
git clone https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-fermion.git
cd myqlm-fermion
pip install .
```
